# microGA
microgenetic algorythm for parameter optimisation (for NEMO-LOBTER/PISCES-type biogeochemical modesl)

## Aim

Optimization of the parameters of the PISCES biogeochemical model using a micro-genetic algorithm.

For now, it has only been applied to optimize the parameter of the PISTER model in 1D at the BATS JGOFS station. See [Ayata et al (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.12.010).

## Principle of the parameter calibration using a micro-genetic algorithm (uGA)

### Description of the uGA

Genetic algorithms are stochastic methods in which a population of parameters evolves with mutation/selection processes.

In the particular case of micro-genetic algorithms, the size of the population is small and no mutation is considered (Carroll, 1996). A micro-genetic algorithm with binary coding, elitism, tournament selection of the parents, and uniform cross-over was used (Carroll, 1996; Schartau & Oschlies, 2003).

At the beginning, a set (or population) of parameter vectors (individuals) is randomly generated within a predefined range. Each parameter vector is coded as a binary string (chromosome). Then, at each generation, the misfit of each parameter vector (fitness of each individual) is estimated as the misfit (cost function) between the data and the model outputs for this parameter vector. The parameter vector with the lowest misfit (best individual of its generation or elite) is conserved to the next generation. Then, four vectors are randomly chosen and associated in two pairs. The vectors with the lowest misfit (best fitness) within each pair are selected (parents), and a new parameter vector (child) is produced by randomly crossing each bit of the two selected vectors. This process (reproduction) is repeated until the replenishment of the population. New generations are produced (evolution), until the population of parameter vectors has converged (all the vectors are identical to the elite). Then, a new generation is randomly generated, with the elite conserved.

This process is repeated N times for a population whose size was chosen equal to the number of parameters to optimize (Schartau & Oschlies, 2003). For a given model, the parameter space has to be reduced to the parameters for which the cost function is the most sensible. Such information can be learnt from preliminary sensibility analyses (Ayata et al, submitted, have optimized four to seven parameters depending on the model).
